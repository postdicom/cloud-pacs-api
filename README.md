# PostDICOM Cloud PACS API
PostDICOM is a cloud-based software service for archiving and viewing images obtained from medical imaging devices (such as ultrasound imaging, MRI, CT, radiography, nuclear imaging, etc.).

PostDICOM enables all of the regular features of PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) – storing, accessing, and sharing your medical imaging files – to be executed within a cloud environment using the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) protocol. This eliminates the need for hardware-based storage, lowering your costs and further optimizing your medical imaging archiving system.
